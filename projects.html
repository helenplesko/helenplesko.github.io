				<div class="projectmiddle">
					<div class="projecttext">
						<p>For this project, a simple terrain analysis was conducted to find the most suitable areas for a picnic in the Peterborough Area of Ontario.
						The criteria considered in the analysis were slope, aspect, proximity to infrastructure, and proximity to natural phenomena including parks and vegetation.
						3D visualization was added to the cartographic output to provide an additional perspective to one of the most suitable areas for a picnic.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

					<h4>Skills Demonstrated:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Compared various spatial interpolation methods and created a contour DEM using one that fit best</li>
							<li>Conducted a simple terrain analysis in ArcGIS Pro using the DEM and various ArcGIS Tools</li>
							<li>Created a 3D visualization of an area on the map using ArcGIS Pro's Local Scene</li>
							<li>Created a cartographic output, keeping visual hierarchy in mind</li>
